Now, lets use the terminal to navigate to our Express root directory, 
and run 'nodemon server.js' to start our express server.

Let's open a secondary terminal window and navigate to our Angular's root directory 
(within our Express project folder), and run the 'ng build --watch' command. As mentioned above, 
this will build our 'dist' folder as well as run a mini server to keep watch over our Angular 
files incase of changes.

Our MEAN application is nearly complete. Remember, every time we want to launch a MEAN project, 
we need to run both the Express server (by navigating our terminal to our Express root directory 
and running 'nodemon server.js'), as well as the Angular server (by navigating a second terminal 
window to our Angular root directory and running 'ng build --watch').
